ala witgenstein - we accept (after review of literature, ask me for sources):
	- the roughly linear progressions from sensory to shortterm to longterm - synchronously
	- limitations in shortterm/working memory are the principle bottleneck in learning
	- humans build representations of concepts(just say yes cody, it really doesn't mode) they are exposed to 
	- expertise results from automatization
	- automatization results ininaccessability of processes (radical plasticity)
	- developing expert knowlege relies on automatization of some set of relevant fundamental models
	- every person learns in a slightly different way (prior experience, sensory biases, ...)
	- teaching (at least selecting examples) primes for learning
	
from these it could be infered that a pedagogy should :
	- avoid overload of working memory
	- seek to automatize fundamentls derived from a pedagogically driven introspection of expert knowlege
		- these will be of two forms ala early AI expert systems
			- practices 
			- knowlege base
	- be highly selective in the expamples presented to students
	- be (to a great extent) static, modular, and effective when presented without a teacher
	- include periods of peer-to-peer (peer may be self) lesson creation
