let's science teaching:    learning != doing


weekend's goal:  skim literature review, selection of principles to apply for classes/reactish project
	worked examples
		selected by what criteria?
	page 12
	process worksheets for : inheriting, modifying, reactlying
	:: clear objectives
		classes, inheritance, ...
		what are single page apps - react style
		create a simple app function run in the browser
	        readable code
                	informative variable names
                	helpful comments
                	simple methods
                	overview readme
	teaching and lesson building
	difficult exercises
	learning and performance zones - link to video
	ordering of concepts
		how?
	:: my deliverables
		CSTD outline
		standalone material and instructions
			constructive examples connected to process worksheets
			completed examples of concepts, labeled
			sample final project
			challenging exercises implementing introduced conepts and with accompanying process worksheet
		follow first principles of instruction ?

	it ignores now known cognitive mechanisms of learning
	article provides guided learning strategies
	LIMIT LOAD ON WORKING MEMORY

	: worked examples
	: process worksheets - van MerrieÌˆnboer, 1997
	giving only tips and resources not too helpful afterall
		instead give process worksheets?
	cognitive task analysis (Schraagen, Chipman, & Shalin, 2000)
	: page 12 after this citation
	expert representations are long-built, attempting to force on learners may impede.  16-17
		accuracy of expert self-report - questionable due to automation
		content vs pedagogical knowledge

		1) representative real-world problem
		2) activation of prior experience		
		3) demo through worked examples
		4) application of skills through practice
		5) planned integration of skills into real-world problem
	
	HUMAN COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE pg 27
		Atkinson and Shiffrin architecture is assumed
			sensory - shorterm - longterm
		long-term memory is (coutnerintuitively?) crucial to performance and cognitive tasks - chessboard recognition
		!! don't clutter working memory
		long-term working memory differs (nearly unlimited)
		3 points from pg 31

Direct Instruction vs. Discovery:The Long View
	in the long term, consistent practice over novel and varied applications of a concept will yield lasting results regarless of teaching style
		in a 12 week program with 1 week per topic this is irrelevant on the scale of days and lectures
		but relevant when choosing projects and exercises - reinforce old concepts		
	done on kids
